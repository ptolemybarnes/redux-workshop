# Create your own redux

In this workshop you are going to **implement your own Redux store**. To be clear, you will not be using Redux. Rather, the objective is to understand what Redux is and how it works by implementing it.

The design of redux emphasises:
- Immutability
- Composability 
- A single source of truth for application state
